1)What do you mean by java?
-->java is a programming language.simply java is used to communicate with computers.
   java is platform independent programming language.java is robust,secure,high level,object oriented programming language.

2)Explain the jvm architecture?
-->jvm is a java virtual machine is an abstract machine. it is a virtual machine beacause it doesn't exist physically.
   jvm loads the code,verify the code then execute the code and it provide runtime environment in which the byte code is executed.

3)What is the use of Controll statement in java?
-->Control statements in Java are used to control the flow of execution in a program. 
   Control statements allow programmers to make decisions, iterate over a set of values, and control the flow of code execution.
   
4)What is pc register?
-->The PC register is an internal component of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is responsible for executing Java bytecode.

5)What is hotspot profiler?
-->
6)Where the jvm located in file explorer?
-->the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) itself is not located in the file explorer 
   The exact location of the JVM installation will depend on your operating system and the version of Java you have installed.

7)What is jdk?
-->The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software
   development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets.
   It contains JRE and development tools.
   It physically exists.

8)What is jre?
-->JRE is a java runtime environment.
   It is a software package provided by oracle.
   That allows you to run Java applications on your computer or device.
   JRE includes the JVM and required runtime libraries.
 
9)What is execution engine?
-->An execution engine is a component of a runtime system that is responsible for executing and running computer
 programs or scripts. It interprets and executes the code written in a specific programming language or bytecode.

10)Can you explain the System.out.println()
-->System is a class
   out is an object of the printstream class
   println is an method of the printstream class.

11)Can you please explain the public static void main(String args[])?
-->public is a access modifier.public means it is visible to all.

12)What kind of mainly data types in java?
-->There is primitive and non primitive data tyeps in java.
   primitive data types are int,boolean,double,long,char,byte,float and short
   non primitive data types are array,string, etc.\

13)What is the size of int data type?
-->4 byte

14)What is the size of boolean data type?
-->1 bit

15)What is variable?
--> variable is a container which hold the data.

16)what is the default value of char data type?
-->2 byte

17)what is the default value of boolean data type?
-->1 bit
18)Difference between break and continue statements.
--> we use break statement to break the current flow of the programme.
    continue statement continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at the specified condition

19)Which is considered as a selection statement?
-->selection statement is used in program to make the decision and execute the different block of codes.
if else is the selection statement.

20)Which is considered as a jump statement?
-->jump statements transfer the execution control to the other part of the program.

21)Mention some advantages and disadvantages of Arrays.
-->Advantages of Arrays:

Efficient access to elements using indexes.
Sequential storage allows for easy iteration and sequential operations.
Random access capability to retrieve or modify specific elements.
Fixed size provides efficient memory allocation and predictable memory usage.

Disadvantages of Arrays:

Fixed size can limit dynamic resizing.
Contiguous memory allocation may lead to memory issues.
Inefficient insertion and deletion operations.
Potential wasted space if array size is larger than the number of elements.

22)What will happen if you do not initialize an Array?
-->the elements of the array will typically have default values assigned to them based on the data type.

23)What is the default value of Array in Java?
-->the default values of array elements depend on the data type of the array. 

24)Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
-->yes we can declare an array without assigning the size of an array.

25)Where is an Array stored in JVM memory?
-->Array stored in JVM memory in heap memory.

26)Can a Negative number be passed in Array size?
-->no
