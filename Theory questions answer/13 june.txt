Q1.What is JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and why is it important?
-->It is an abstract machine.it doesn't physically exist.jvm provide the runtime environment in which byte code run
   jvm perform task like loads code,verifies code and compile the code and also provide the runtime environment.

Q2.Explain the concept of platform independence provided by JVM.
-->platform is a hardware or software in which program runs.
   java is write once run anywhere language.java code can be executed on many platforms.
   java compile the code and convert it into byte code.and byte code can be executed on any platform.

Q3.What are the key components of JVM architecture?
-->JVM is a abstract machine.its internal architecture contains the key components of JVM architecture are classloader, 
   Memory area and execution engine.

Q4.Describe the purpose and function of the Classloader in JVM.
-->classloader is a subsystem of jvm which is used to load the class files.
   whenever we run java program it is loaded first by classloader.

Q5.What are the different runtime data areas in JVM and what are their functions?
-->The runtime data areas in JVM are class area,heap,stack,pc register andnative method stack,
class area stores the per class structure such as runtime constant pool heap area is a runtime data area in which objects are allocated.
java stack holds frames.program counter register contains the address of the JVM.Native method stack contains all the native methods used in applications.

Q6.Explain the difference between the Heap and the Stack in JVM.
-->It is the runtime data area in which objects are allocated.
   java stack stores the frames.
   
Q7.How does the Garbage Collector work in JVM? What are its goals?
-->

Q8.What is the role of the JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler in JVM?
-->JIT is used to improve the performance.
   JIT compiler parts the byte code that have same functionallity at the same time.
   reduces the amount of time needed for compilation.

Q9.Describe the steps involved in JIT compilation and its benefits.
-->firstly it parts the byte code that have same functionality at the same time.
   then reduces the amount of time needed for compilation.

Q10.What is bytecode? How does JVM execute bytecode?
-->Bytecode in java is a set of instructions for java virtual machine.
   They can be executed by interpretetion.by JIT compiling and any other technique chosen by designer for particular JVM.

Q11.Explain the role of the interpreter in JVM.
-->interpreter is a program that translate the programming language into comprensible language.
1.It translates only one statement of the program at a time.
2. More often than not are smaller than compilers.
3. Errors are shown line by line.
4. It does not convert source code into object code instead it scans it line by line.

Q12.What is the purpose of the Method Area in JVM? What kind of information does it store?
-->Class(Method) Area stores per-class structures such as runtime constant pool,field and method data,the code for methods.
