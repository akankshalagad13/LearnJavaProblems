1.What is a constructor in object-oriented programming?
-->Constructor is a block of code.
   Constructor is used to initialize an object.It is called when object is created.
   Constructor name is must be same as class name.
   Constructor may not have any return type.
   Constructor is not used for static method.
   There are three types of constructor:
            1)Non Argument constructor
            2)Parametrized constructor
            3)Default constructor
    when there is no constructor in java java compiler provide the default constructor.
 
2.What is the purpose of a constructor?
-->The main purpose of the constructor is used to initialize an object.

3.How is a constructor different from a regular method?
-->regular methods are used to perform specific task or operation while constructor are used to initialize an object.

4.Can a class have multiple constructors?
-->Yes, class can have a multiple constructor.

5..What is the default constructor?
-->When there is no constructor in java java compiler provide a default constructor to initialize an object.

6..What is constructor overloading?
-->Constructor overloading means a class can have a multiple constructor with same name but different parameters.

7.How is a constructor invoked in a class?
-->Constructor is involked automatically when object of the class is created.

8.What is inheritance in object-oriented programming?
-->it is a mechanism in which  child class(subclass) acquires the properties and behaviours of parent class or superclass is called inheritance in oop.

9.What are the benefits of using inheritance?
-->using inheritance we can reuse the code.
   the inheritance is used in abstraction.
   inheritance makes the code flexible to use.
   it minimize the size of code.

10.What is a superclass and subclass in inheritance?
-->subclass acquire all the properties of superclass.
   Superclass is inherited by subclass.

11.What is an array?
-->array is collection of similar type of data types with contiguos memort location.
   Array in java is index based the first elemnt is stored at 0 index and second elemnt is placed at 1 index.

12.Can the size of an array be changed after it is declared?
-->the size of the array is fixed we cannot change the size once is is declared.

13..What is the maximum number of elements an array can hold?
-->It depend on the programming language and its data type.

14.What is the difference between a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional array?
-->store a single list of same data type in one-dimentional
   In two-dimentional list of list of same data type is used.
   in one dimension represent multiple data items as list
   In two-dimention represent multiple data items as table in the form of rows and columns.

15.How do you initialize an array with specific values?
-->int arr[]=new int[];

16.What is the purpose of an array in programming?
-->the main purpose of the array is used to storing multiple elements of the same data type in a contiguos memory location.
